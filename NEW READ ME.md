Research question 1: What indicators strongly relate to the goal of no poverty and what is the trend within those indicators?
Research question 2: to what extend have individual countries reached the no poverty goals?
*Subquestion could be*
- What is causing that certain countries climb up from poverty? (which policies did help)
- What is causing that certain countries are still stuck in poverty? (maybe visualise conflicts or other causes)
Research question 3: What is the future trend or certain countries regarding their poverty goals
*Suquestion could be*
- Are the 2030 poverty goals achieveable in 2030?
