UN 2030 TARGET GOALS
- By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day
- By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions
- Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable
- By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance
- By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters
- Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions
- Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions

RESEARCH QUESTION

What indicators strongly relate to the goal of no poverty and what are their future trends for individual countries?

subquestions:
- What indicators strongly relate to the goal of no poverty?
     - How did those indicators developed in the last decades (for individual countries)?
- To what extend have individual countries reached the no poverty goals?
     - What is causing that certain countries climb up from poverty? (which policies did help)
     - What is causing that certain countries are still stuck in poverty? (maybe visualise conflicts or other causes)
- What is the future trend or certain countries regarding their poverty goals
     - Are the 2030 poverty goals achieveable in 2030?
